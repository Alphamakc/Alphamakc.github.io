    <td>  My career goal is to become a graphic designer and work in advertising or logos.
  I went to San Pasqual High School for 2 years then transferred to Palm Desert High School, where I am currently attending. The college that I am interested in is Academy of Art University and I want to major in graphic design.
	I do not have much work experience, but I did apply for some jobs and hoping to work soon. I also do not have much volunteer work experience because I was told I needed to be older to volunteer.
	I speak english very fluently and I can understand/ am learning spanish.  I have token multiple of art, coding and graphic design courses in school and online.
	I was in honor roll in San Pasqual and I took multiple swim classes during middle and am skilled in drawing and graphic design.
